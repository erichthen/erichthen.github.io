            <p>This application will serve my mother's tutoring business for kids with dyslexia. The purpose of this application is to serve as a portal for the owner as well as the parents of the students. The intended users of this website are the owner and the parents, not the children.</p>
            <p>The content of the website will include a calendar of a parent or the owner's sessions for that month. Additionally, there will be options to send or view an invoice, cancel or reschedule one or all sessions, 
                write and view session notes, email the owner or email a parent, join the Zoom session, and add or remove a client. The parents and the owner will have a different dashboard. 
            </p>

                <li><strong>Intended Users: </strong>Parents/Clients</li>
                <li><strong>Content: </strong>Page title, and a form where the user is asked to provide information so they can be registered and authenticated.</li>
                <li><strong>Data entry: </strong>The data the user will enter on this page is their name, email, child's name, desired password, and day and time of their sessions.</li>
                <li><strong>Data field validation: </strong>The email needs to be validated, the password needs to meet criteria (e.g. length, numbers & special characters), 
                    the date needs to be available.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Buttons/Hyperlinks/Dropdowns: </strong>There will be a submit button, a link to a time zone converter, and a dropdown for dates.</li>

                <li><strong>Purpose: </strong>This page will have two versions: one for client and one for owner. It will serve as a means to communicate 
                    between owner and client and see messages.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Intended Users: </strong>Parent/Client and Owner/Admin</li>

                <li><strong>Actions: </strong>When the user clicks the view messages toggle/dropdown, recent messages will appear. When user hits the send button, the data will be processed and 
                    an automated email will be sent containing the message. Additionally, they will now see their message in the recent messages section.

                <li><strong>Name: Send invoice</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Purpose: </strong>This page will allow the owner to send out an invoice to a client.</li>
                <li><strong>Intended Users: </strong>Owner/Admin</li>
                <li><strong>Content: </strong>Shared header and footer, page title, and a form to fill out.</li>
                <li><strong>Data entry: </strong>The owner will select the recipient parent, upload the invoice, and add an optional message.</li>
                <li><strong>Data field validation: </strong>I will validate the file ensuring a PDF format, as well as the optional message using type set to "text".</li>
                <li><strong>Buttons/Hyperlinks/Dropdowns: </strong>The owner will select the recipient from a dropdown, there will also be buttons to upload the file and send the invoice.</li>
                <li><strong>Actions: </strong>When the user clicks upload, they will choose a file from their system. When the user hits send, the data will be processed and an 
                    automated email will be sent to the selected parent containing the invoice and the message if present.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Special notes (IMPORTANT): </strong>I have slightly deviated from the site map–the user will not have a view invoices page. 
                    They will instead receive an email with the invoice.

                <li><strong>Name: Cancel/Reschedule</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Purpose: </strong>This page will have two versions–one for owner and one for parents. It will allow the users to cancel or reschedule one or all sessions.</li>
                <li><strong>Intended Users: </strong>Owner/Admin and Client/Parent</li>
                <li><strong>Content: </strong>Shared header and footer, page title, buttons for the various scheduling options, and forms for the respective operations.</li>
                <li><strong>Data entry: </strong>Most of it will be selecting data, not entering it. Though clients have to provide a message if they are canceling.</li>
                <li><strong>Data field validation: </strong>I will validate the cancel message as type set to text and validate data so it only shows available slots.</li>
                <li><strong>Buttons/Hyperlinks/Dropdowns: </strong>There will be buttons to select whether one wants to cancel or reschedule, and one session or all sessions. 
                    There will be dropdowns for: Owner to select which parent will be canceled or rescheduled, owner to select the session or sessions, client to 
                    select which session/sessions to cancel or reschedule. There will also be a button to confirm the change in schedule.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Actions: </strong>The cancel or reschedule and one or all sessions buttons will control what is on the screen. Data is processed such that only available slots are shown, 
                    and only sessions of that client show when choosing the session to cancel or reschedule. The confirm button will look up the session in the database and apply the requested operation.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Special notes (IMPORTANT): </strong>I have slightly deviated from the site map, I am combining cancel and reschedule into one page. 
                    Client and owner will still have their own versions.

                <li><strong>Name: Session Notes</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Purpose: </strong>This page will allow the owner to write notes about a session.</li>
                <li><strong>Intended Users: </strong>Owner/Admin</li>
                <li><strong>Content: </strong>This page will consist of two dropdowns: one to select the client and one to select the desired session of the client to write notes about.
                    The notes will display if they are already written for that session, otherwise there will be a textbox and a submit button. 
                </li>
                <li><strong>Data entry: </strong>The data entry will be the textbox to write the session notes.</li>
                <li><strong>Data field validation: </strong>The session notes will be validated as type set to text, as well as validated that text exists. The dropdown options 
                    will be validated such that they only display past sessions for the specified client.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Buttons/Hyperlinks/Dropdowns: </strong>There will be dropdowns as mentioned in point number 4. There will be a button to submit the notes.</li>
                <li><strong>Actions: </strong> When the first dropdown has been selected, the second dropdown will display sessions of only the client selected in the first dropdown. 
                    When the notes are written and the submit button is pressed, the data will be stored so the owner can see it in the future, and an automated email containing the message
                    will be sent to the selected client.
                 </li>
                <li><strong>Special notes (IMPORTANT): </strong>This page will actually only be for the owner, as the client can view the notes in an email.</li>

            <hr>
            
            <h3 id="functionality-title">Dynamic Functionality</h3>
            
            <p>
                To begin, there will be forms across the website. Namely, forms on the cancel and reschedule page, on the message page, invoice page, session note page, etc. These forms
                will have interactive dropdowns that filter data and display them as options, such as showing the sessions for one specific client on the session notes page. This 
                functionality would be something similar to the <a class="interactive-link" href="/itis3135/forms.html">form page of this website</a>. The purpose of this functionality is to consolidate the 
                    collection of data from the user in an organized manner. 
                <br>
                <br>
                Additionally, both dashboards will have an interactive calendar, where one can click on a day that contains a session and see information about that session in a pop-up window. 
                This is something that will be similar to <a class="interactive-link" href="https://workspace.google.com/intl/en-US/products/calendar/">Google Calendar</a>. 
                There will be automated emails that come with some of the operations, such as on the invoice page, message and notes pages, etc. Clients who are invited will receive an invitation email
                that will lead them to the registration page. Data will be dynamically extracted and put into the email. There will also be session reminder emails. An example of a site that 
                uses automated emails heavily is <a class="interactive-link" href="https://canvas.instructure.com/login/canvas">Canvas</a>. The purpose of this is to display the schedule of the user in a more suitable way
                than just text.
                <br>

                Most of the functionality and interactivity will be in the form of database operations. For example, the database will retrieve only the time slots that are available in the registration and reschedule pages. 
                The database will include clients and their information, scheduled sessions, and messages as well as session notes. This data will be dynamically adjusted in the cancel/reschedule page, 
                message and session note pages, etc. There are a plethora of websites that work with a database, such as the Canvas site mentioned above. The purpose of the database is it is necessary in order to keep track
                of the things the site owner needs to keep track of.

                I will most likely add interactive images to the about page. This could be either in the form of a slideshow, an image that changes when you hover over it, an image that moves around, etc. An 
                example of a site that has images with multiple types of interactivity is <a class="interactive-link" href="https://www.tonyrobbins.com/">tonyrobins.com</a>. The purpose of this is to 
                make the website more engaging and appealing.
