            <p id="what-text">Typical meditation does not entail sitting like a monk for hours on end in order to reach enlightenment. 
                Meditation is hard to define because it comes in so many forms. I like to think of it as the deliberate 
                exploration of your consciousness. Well, what is consciousness? Consciousness, to me, is the 
                awareness of ones existence, and <strong><i>not</i></strong> your thoughts. So through meditation, you explore, observe, and can even change the ways in which your consciousness 
                percieves how you think about yourself and the world you exist in.</p>

            <p id="about-text-1">My name is Erich Then, and I am a junior at UNC Charlotte studying the systems and networks concentration of computer science. 
                I transferred from UCSD because I couldn't study CS and I didn't have the best time there. I've moved around <strong>a lot</strong> (8 states, 2 countries), 
                and I went to high school in Kenya–which was awesome. I am passionate about teaching, programming, and of course, exploring my consciousness through meditation. 
                Check out my <a href="https://webpages.charlotte.edu/ethen/itis3135/introduction.html"> introduction page</a> for a little more about me.</p>

                    <p>I, like all of us, have many stressors in my life. I wasn't good at dealing with them (like, at all). Then I discovered that I can train my mind to be less susceptible to the 
                        not-so-great thoughts that come and go. I started really slow, and it was extremely hard to remain focused 
                        while meditating (having ADHD does not help). I thought it wasn't for me. But it being so hard made me realize how much I needed it, so I persisted. It got a little bit easier each time, and I have since slowly gotten better
                        at controlling my attention while dissociating from my thoughts. <i>Do not get the impression that I am a guru or good at meditation.</i>
                        I am still a beginner, and I will be for a while. My outlook on life and personal wellbeing, however, has drastically improved. Thus, I am eager to share my experience and what I have learned when it comes to meditation.

                Most of us, myself included, have a <strong>terrible</strong> grip on our leash, and we grow annoyed and frustrated because of it. Through consistent meditation, you tighten the grip. You might even become that arrogant dog owner
                who makes sure everyone knows they don't need a leash. Not quite though, if you reach that level of control over your mind, I can personally guarantee that you won't be arrogant.

                 who they really are. You can crack that case if you try.

                    So, if you are just starting out, pick a meditation you like and do it for 5-10 minutes either every day or every other day. I strongly reccomend taking those 5 minutes either right when you wake up or right before you sleep.

                <ul>
                    <li>What is the data-section attribute, and how can I use it to only have one event listener for all of my nav buttons?</li>

                    <li>This is good. We need to make sure the "what" section is the default section, the one that shows on page load. Right now, all of the sections are present on the page load.</li>

                    <li>I got the section contents to fade in when their nav button is clicked, but how do I get home to fade in on a page load and reload?</li>

                    <li>I tried to make sure the gif and the box containing the are the exact same height by setting both to a certain height, however they still aren't aligned. 
                        It is very close to being aligned, but not quite there. This is beginning to annoy me because I have resorted to using margins, inching a tiny bit at a time, 
                        but it seems the match I am looking must be to the hundredth of a single pixel apparently. Look at my code and tell me why their heights (or positions, or both) 
                        are not the exact same. [Gave html and css to AI]</li>

                    <li>Thank you. Now, I have 12 images in my images folder, and I have resized all of them to be the same size. I want to make 2 automatically progressing slideshows that 
                        will be next to eachother in a row. There will be 6 images in each one. One image will be present on the screen at a time for each slideshow (so two images will be on the page 
                        at a time). We will wrap the index of the images so once we get to the last image we go back to the first one. We also need to dynamically change the contents of the fig 
                        caption element when the image changes so the caption matches the new image. Also, add a fading in and out effect for when the img and figcaption change. 
                        I have set up the html, here it is: [gave my html]. Give me detailed steps on how to implement this in JS using Jquery. Then, give me all of the CSS that is needed to do so.</li>

                    <li> -Ok. Now, there is something I want to fix. When I zoom in and out, the GIF and the facts container shift horizontally. Also, they are not centered on the screen even before I zoom in and out. Here is my code
                        [gave code] please tell me why this is happening, and how to fix it.</li>

                    <li>Before we continue, there is another issue. The pages look great on my laptop: the main content is in the middle of the screen, and the footer is at the bottom. However, on my monitor, a larger screen, 
                        everything is near the top. The footer is in the middle of the screen, and the main content is in the first third or so of the screen, vertically speaking. Let's make it so regardless of how big or small the screen is, 
                        the header is always at the top (this is already the case), the main content is in the middle, and the footer is at the bottom of the screen.</li>

                    <li>I am making a page for types of meditation and how to do them. I want buttons to aligned in the center of the page when the page loads, and the buttons will all be in a row. 
                        These buttons will be the different types of meditation. When a button is clicked, an ordered list and an image will slide on to the screen (we can use jquery for this animation) 
                        and they will be located below the buttons. Below the buttons, the ordered list tag will be on the right, and the image will be on the left. 
                        Thus, the image should slide onto the screen from the left, and the ordered list should slide onto the screen from the right. Also, the ordered list will slide in order, 
                        i.e. the first step will slide onto the screen, then the second step will slide onto the screen a second after the first, and so on. 
                        Here are the types of meditation I am doing: Mindfulness, Breath Awareness, Mantra-based, Transcendental, Love & Kindness, and Body Scan. 
                        As for the contents of the ordered list, don't worry about it yet. You can simply put "first step" as the text for the first item, and so on. </li>

                    <li>Can you tell me why the ol list is appearing unordered and why the list items are black when they have been styled to be a different color. Also, if a li item goes to a new line, it should not be at 
                        the same horizontal position of the bullet point, it should be at the same horizontal position as the text in the above line. Here is my HTML: [snippet of html], here is my JS: [snippet of JS], and here is my CSS: [snippet of CSS]</li>

                    <li>[gave a snippet of my JavaScript] The image slides from the left, but the list items do not. They do appear sequentially which is great, but I also want them to slide in from the right. 
                        It seems the syntax is similar, so why aren't the list elements sliding in from the right? Instead, they are fading in</li>

                    <li>On this page, I have two images that are next to each other in a row. They both are in figure elements, and they both have figcaptions under them. 
                        I want the images and their captions to move across the screen continually. They will move horizontally, from left to right. 
                        One can go first, and the other one can follow. When an image and a caption is completely off the screen on the right side 
                        (meaning the left side of the image/caption is now off the screen), it will wrap and start again from the left. Here is my HTML for this page, 
                        and in it you can see the images div and the two figures inside of it: [gave my HTML for this section]. Tell me how to do this and let's do it in steps.</li>
