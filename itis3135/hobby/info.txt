    SECTION: WHERE
    <section>

    <h2>Where?</h2>

    <p>Write something about ideal locations for meditation and not ideal places</p>

    **my own notes, not apart of the layout: 
        good places: quite place at home, nature settings, retreats, religous establishments
        bad places: noisy or high traffic areas, uncomfortable or unsafe environments, work, places with negative associations

    <figure>Here, there will be a self moving slide show of photos of ideal places</figure>

    SECTION: HOW
    <section>

    <h2>How?</h2>

    <p>This will be a p tag telling the user to look at the table and see what they are interested in</p>

    <table>Columns: Type of meditation, use cases, reccomended duration, difficulty</table>
    
    **The first column (type of mediation) will also be a button that the user can click.
    When the user clicks the button, steps for that mediation will display in a p tag that pops up. Also, an image will appear next to that p tag. 
    The image will be different for each type clicked. As for the format: the page will load with the table in the center of the screen. When a user clicks a type from 
    the leftmost column, the table will shift to the left to make room for the p tag and the image that will be to the right of the table. The p tag will be below the image. 

    Contents of the table: 

    First row: Mindfullness meditation: staying in the present

    AI PROMPTS I USED:

    - What is the data-section attribute, and how can I use it to only have one event listener for all of my nav buttons?

    - This is good. We need to make sure the "what" section is the default section, the one that shows on page load. Right now, all of the sections are present on the page load. 

    - I got the section contents to fade in when their nav button is clicked, but how do I get home to fade in on a page load and reload?

    - I tried to make sure the gif and the box containing the <ul> are the exact same height by setting both to a certain height, however they still aren't aligned. 
      It is very close to being aligned, but not quite there. This is beginning to annoy me because I have resorted to using margins, inching a tiny bit at a time, 
      but it seems the match I am looking must be to the hundredth of a single pixel apparently. Look at my code and tell me why their heights (or positions, or both) 
      are not the exact same. <gave html and css to AI>

    - Thank you. Now, I have 12 images in my images folder, and I have resized all of them to be the same size. I want to make 2 automatically progressing slideshows that 
      will be next to eachother in a row. There will be 6 images in each one. One image will be present on the screen at a time for each slideshow (so two images will be on the page 
      at a time). We will wrap the index of the images so once we get to the last image we go back to the first one. We also need to dynamically change the contents of the fig 
      caption element when the image changes so the caption matches the new image. Also, add a fading in and out effect for when the img and figcaption change. 
      I have set up the html, here it is: <gave my html>. Give me detailed steps on how to implement this in JS using Jquery. Then, give me all of the CSS that is needed to do so.

    -Ok. Now, there is something I want to fix. When I zoom in and out, the GIF and the facts container shift horizontally. Also, they are not centered on the screen even before I zoom in and out. Here is my code
    <gave code> please tell me why this is happening, and how to fix it.

    - Before we continue, there is another issue. The pages look great on my laptop: the main content is in the middle of the screen, and the footer is at the bottom. However, on my monitor, a larger screen, 
    everything is near the top. The footer is in the middle of the screen, and the main content is in the first third or so of the screen, vertically speaking. Let's make it so regardless of how big or small the screen is, 
    the header is always at the top (this is already the case), the main content is in the middle, and the footer is at the bottom of the screen. 

    - I am making a page for types of meditation and how to do them. I want buttons to aligned in the center of the page when the page loads, and the buttons will all be in a row. 
    These buttons will be the different types of meditation. When a button is clicked, an ordered list and an image will slide on to the screen (we can use jquery for this animation) 
    and they will be located below the buttons. Below the buttons, the ordered list tag will be on the right, and the image will be on the left. 
    Thus, the image should slide onto the screen from the left, and the ordered list should slide onto the screen from the right. Also, the ordered list will slide in order, 
    i.e. the first step will slide onto the screen, then the second step will slide onto the screen a second after the first, and so on. 
    Here are the types of meditation I am doing: Mindfulness, Breath Awareness, Mantra-based, Transcendental, Love & Kindness, and Body Scan. 
    As for the contents of the ordered list, don't worry about it yet. You can simply put "first step" as the text for the first item, and so on.
