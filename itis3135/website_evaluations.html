                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Contrast:</strong> Elements that aren’t the same should be very different so they stand out and are easy to read.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Repition:</strong> Repeating visual elements of the design throughout the piece.</li>
                        <li><strong>Alignment:</strong> All elements should line up and be organized.</li>
                        <li><strong>Proximity:</strong> Elements that are related should be grouped together, whereas separate design elements <br>should have enough space in between to communicate they are different.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <p class="eval-text">Evaluation</p>
                <p class="does-follow" id="does-follow-bad">This website has so many different colors and text sizes and a crazy colorful background, 
                    so contrast is not properly followed.<br> Everywhere you look, there are different colors, sizes, and formats. Repition is not followed. There is some, but very little consistent alignment. <br>There is whitespace in the middle that is random and does not contribute to proximity.
                    Other than that, everything is so jumbled together <br>that there is no meaningful proximity. The developer desperatley needs to refer to the principles listed above.

                <p class="does-follow" id="does-follow-good"> The background is minimalist, and makes the text pop out. Texts are very different but consistent sizes, contrast is well designed.<br>
                    All titles/subtitles, image/video sizes, captions, etc. have consistent sizing respective to the section or type of text that it is.<br>Colors are few and repeated,
                    sections are aligned, titles are aligned, content within sections is all perfectly aligned. <br>There is meaningful–but not too much–white space. Content within sections are close in proximity.
                    This designer clearly knows their CRAP.
