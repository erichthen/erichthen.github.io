            There is nothing better than eagerly cracking open a fortune cookie and wondering what the universe will tell you.
            Well, what if you could give that feeling to someone else, and write the message yourself?!
        </p>
        <p class="info-text" id="info-text-2">
            This is what we do here at Egotistical Terrier Fortunes, and there is nothing egotistical about it!
            Choose the type of cookie you want to send, how many of them, and what you want their fortunes to say. 
        </p>
        <p class="info-text" id="info-text-3">
            It's that easy to change someones day, and even their fate (for the better of course, we have to approve the message)!
